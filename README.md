Instructions:
1. Timeular:
	- Go to [timeular (app) profile](https://profile.timeular.com/#/login)
	- On 'Integrations', click the iCal version of your logged hours and copy the URL
2. Script:
	- Download or copy/paste timeular_ical_parser.py from this repo
	- Open in text editor, and edit the input_url and output_folder (optional) below "if '__name__' == '__main__':"
		- Paste the ical URL in the "input_url" field
		- output_folder options:
			- Add a folder location where you want your generated file to end up
			- Set to null ('') or none (None) to not generate file and only get a print out of total hours over that period (for quick reference)
	- Run from command line (make sure you're using python 3): 'python tiemular_ical_parser.py'
	- Add optional start and end dates:
		- Date inputs take time change into account
		- If one time spans two days, the start date (before midnight) will be used for the date filter
3. Use in Excel (if output_folder was given and file was generated):
	- Open output file location
	- Right click new file -> open with Excel
	- Manipulate as needed
