	- Open in text editor, and edit fields below "if '__name__' == '__main__':"
		- You'll need to look up the time difference between yourself and UTC. For example, I'm MST, which is (currently) 6 hours behind, hence the "-6"
		- start_date and end_date inputs take time change into account
		- If one time spans two days, the start date (before midnight) will be used for the date filter
